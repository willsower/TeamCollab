## Files

**Controllers**

Controllers are the files which define the thing which goes inside the routes.

**Middleware**

Middleware are the functions that you would want your route to go through before using the rest of the defined controllers, it is mostly used for routes which require authentication, uploads, etc.

**Models**

Models are where all your schema and it’s related functions would lie inside the schema files, what this should do is keep the requests and responses away from itself and not throw an error, this way the errors generated would not affect the schemas and the ones generated by it won’t be confused by the normal APIs

**Routes**

The name suggests what this would, it is basically the routes’ definition, kind, endpoint, middleware and controllers to be used
